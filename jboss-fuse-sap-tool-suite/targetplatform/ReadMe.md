# Prerequisite

This Target Platform requires to have access to a private repository  http://fuse-sap.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/repositories/fuse-sap-data-layer/updatesite

If you don't have access to it, you will need to get the SAP Data Layer plugins from a previous installation of SAP Tooling on your machine and then update the Target file.

# How to build use the TP

- First launch mvn install
- Open target/sap-tooling-multiple.target and click *Set as Target Platform*

Both operations are taking quite some time. Please be patient.
