# Prerequisite

This Target Platform requires to have access to a private repository http://tooling.fuse-qe.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/p2/sap.nightly.site/

If you don't have access to it, you will need to get the SAP Data Layer plugins from a previous installation of SAP Tooling on your machine and then update the Target file.

# How to build use the TP

- First launch mvn install
- Open target/sap-tooling-multiple.target and click *Set as Target Platform*

Both operations are taking quite some time. Please be patient.
